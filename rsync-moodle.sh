#!/bin/bash

## Use case
#
# You have your moodle code for dev environment some where at e.g.
# ~/workspace/moodle
# and an additional plugin that you work on, checked out at:
# ~/workspace/moodle-frankenstyle_pluginname
# and you must synchronize the separate plugin under git control
# with the install dir of the plugin in your Moodle installation.
# In the past, I used two separate scripts inside each plugin
# repo that I have checked out. This script handles both of these
# individual scripts, automates the directory naming and should be
# generic for all plugin development, instead of having two scripts
# in each plugin directory (which need to be excluded via
# .git/info/exclude) from any commits.
#
## Usage
#
# Change to the directory where your plugin is checked out and where
# you handle all git related commands. From here you want to
# synchronize your moodle dev environment with the latest version
# of the plugin.
#
# rsync-moodle.sh
# Optional arguments:
# -m <dir> The base directory of your moodle installation.
# -n Test only, without actually copying the files.
# -p <dir> The exact plugin dir where the code is pushed to.
# -r Reverse: copy the code from the moodle dir into the current
#    working directory of the plugin (e.g. you have developed
#    your plugin and need to commit and push the changes to the
#    plugin repository).
#
## Configuration
#
# Use the environment variables:
# MOODLE_SRC_DIR = Directory where your moodle installation is
#                  located at. Use of -m or -p overrides this.
#
# In my ~/bin directory I created two files that call this script.
# There is rsync_moodle.sh with the content:
# ~/workspace/moodle-tools/rsync-moodle.sh $@
# and moodle_rsync.sh with the content:
# ~/workspace/moodle-tools/moodle-rsync.sh -r $@
# that replaces the scripts which I had inside each plugin.
